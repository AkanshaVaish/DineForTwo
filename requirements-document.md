# Requirements Document: Dinner for Two
### Project Abstract
“Dinner for Two,” a website that promotes speed-date dinners and assists in making reservations, with a particular catch to the system that incentivizes dates to actually show up with a literal “free lunch” impetus.

### Customer
* Residents of Vancouver, specifically students at Simon Fraser University, which has developed a bad reputation for lack of social stimulation due to its status as a commuter school.
* Students usually feel the peer-to-peer interactions to be lacking, and while they would like to reach out, they ultimately still feel there is little incentive to do so at the risk of rejection or being viewed as awkward.

### Competitive Advantage
Since our application is desktop-based instead of mobile, this gives us the advantage of a bigger display screen with more ways to display data in a beautiful and understandable manner.

This is a system similar to the Tinder mobile application – ours, however, is more specifically geared towards speed dating at restaurants rather than casual meetups.

There is also a trick to our system that aims to uphold accountability with the users. In order to establish a date with our system, a few rules must be followed:

* Both users must first make a deposit with our system.
* If one user does not show up, his/her deposit is forfeited to the other user.
* If both users do not show up, both deposits are forfeited to… Us.

### User Stories

* Future stories:
 * As a user, I want to be able to choose to ‘forgive’ a person for not showing up so that his deposit is not taken from him/her. (EPIC)
 * As a user, I want more advanced search options so that I can choose from dates known to flake more often than others (for free meals). (EPIC)
